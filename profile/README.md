# 🍄 Mushroom Labs

We grow ideas in the dark and see what glows.

- small code spores → occasional weird mushrooms  
- prototypes first, explanations later  
- public when ready, private while noodling

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Quests)

**Q: Who are you?**  
A: A rotating cast of friendly mycelium.

**Q: What do you make?**  
A: Tiny tools, odd utilities, and experiments that sometimes turn into real things.

**Q: Roadmap?**  
A: Rain ➜ mushrooms ➜ maybe docs.

**Q: Are you stealth?**  
A: Yes. If you think you’ve identified us, that was a hallucination produced by poor metadata hygiene.

## House Rules
- keep it lightweight  
- leave the campsite cleaner than you found it  
- commit messages > motivational posters

> If you’re reading this during a review cycle: details are intentionally sparse. We’ll surface more once the spores settle.
